## Basic Overview

A churn prediction case study focused on cleaning, analyzing, and modeling ride-sharing data aimed at seeking the best predictors for retention

## Exploring Data

Intially going into this case study, we decided to tackle the task of cleaning the data and get a better understanding of the data together as a group.

### Initial Intake

Our immediate task was to identify the column we were trying to predict and transform it into a numerical column. We also took care of the other such as phone and city by using get dummies.

Examining the columns further, we looked to see if any features we correlated with any other features. Upon investigation, we saw that surge_pct was highly correlated with avg_surge so we decided to drop avg_surge to

Visualizing the NaN values in the columns, avg_rating_of_driver contianed the most NaN values with 16%. As a group, we decided to use sklearn's SimpleInputer to fill the NaN values with the mean of that column.
